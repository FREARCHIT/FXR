While the game performs seamlessly and as intended within the Unity Editor, we've identified some challenges when testing on the Pico platform. Specifically, players might experience issues related to movement and task interactivity. The lights change colour as supposed, and the sound works. The timer, the logic of the game, the canvas and the tasks work, but only on the Unity Editor.
